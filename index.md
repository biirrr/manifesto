The manifesto on resource re-use intends to draw the attention of the interactive information retrieval (IIR) community to the challenges of research documentation and archiving for future use. Resources are understood as encompassing research designs, research data and research infrastructures. It proposes eight principles for improving the re-use of resources in the IIR community and presents concrete steps on how to achieve them. A five-level system for data archiving and documentation envisions increasingly open and stable documentation and access infrastructures.
